Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE

with open('./src/foo.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)
print(f.closed)

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open('./src/bar.txt', 'w+') as b:
  b.write("first set of lines\n")
  b.write("trying o write a python txt\n")
  b.write("will this work?")
